# Campaign Contract

This project was created in order to showcase the connection between web3 and solidity outside Remix which is common for writing smart contracts.


### `to begin with the campaign...
  one must contribute some amount of ether.`
  - There is a manager who is the owner of the address and has power to help pick who the winner is.
  - One Campaign can carry a few requests.

### Safety
